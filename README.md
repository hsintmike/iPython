# Protein Simulation and Data Analysis in Python

***Michael Tung - Chemical Engineering in Unviersity of Washington***

## Description

This repository contains Python Code for my research projects including:
Analyze protein simulation results from lagre data sets, Amimation of time-dependent data,
Explore several crucial protein properties (e.g.,free energy, ionics effects, folding rate..), Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning and Genomics Data Science....still updating. 

## Outline
### [Protein Structure and Solvent effects][1]

* MDAnalysis package
* H-bond vs simulation time
* Ions numbers around protein vs time
* Ions to hydrophobic core distance vs time

### [Recover Time-Indepentent Free energy from Metadynamics][2]
