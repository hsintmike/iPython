# Protein Simulation and Data Analysis in Python

***Michael Tung - Chemical Engineering in Unviersity of Washington***

## Description

This repository contains Python Code for research projects and exercises including:
Analyze protein simulation results from lagre data sets, Animation of time-dependent data,
Explore several crucial protein properties (e.g.,free energy, ionics effects, folding rate..), Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning and Genomics Data Science....still updating. 

## Outline
### [Protein Structure and Solvent effects][1]

* MDAnalysis package
* H-bond vs simulation time

### [Recover Time-Indepentent Free energy from Metadynamics][2]

* Recover time-idenpentent free energy surface by reference
* Free energy surface contourplot
* Idenitfy basins in reaction coordinates
* Covergence test of single state

### [Statistic Analysis and Sampling][3]

* Poisson Process
* Cumulative Distribution function (CDF)
* Empirical Cuumulative Distribution Funciton (ECDF)
* p-value an KS-test
* Automation Sampling 

### [Time Series Animation][4]
