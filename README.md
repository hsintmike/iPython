# Protein Simulation and Data Analysis in Python

***Michael Tung - ChemE Grad | University of Washington ***

## Description

This repository contains Python Code for research projects and exercises including:
Analyze protein simulation results from lagre data sets, Animation of time-dependent data,
Explore several crucial protein properties (e.g.,free energy, ionics effects, folding rate..), Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning and Genomics Data Science....still updating. 

## Outline
### [Protein Structure and Solvent Effects][1]

* MDAnalysis package

### [Recover Time-Indepentent Free Energy from Metadynamics][2]

* Recover time-idenpentent free energy surface 
* Free energy surface contourplot
* Idenitfy basins in reaction coordinates
* Covergence test of single state

### [Statistic Analysis and Sampling][3]

* Poisson Process
* Cumulative Distribution function (CDF)
* Empirical Cumulative Distribution Funciton (ECDF)
* p-value an KS-test
* Automation Sampling 

### [Time Series Animation][4]
