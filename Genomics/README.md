###Questions
(1) How many records are in the file?
(2) What are the lengths of the sequences in the file?
(3) What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence?
(4) Is there more than one longest or shortest sequence? What are their identifiers?
(5) What is the length of the longest open reading frame(ORF) in the file?
(6) For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that idenitfier?
(7) What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it?
(8) Given a length n, identify all repeats of length n in all sequences in the FASTA file
(9) Determine how many times each repeat occurs in the file, and which is the most frequent repeat of a given length
